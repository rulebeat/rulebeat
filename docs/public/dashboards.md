# Dashboards

![Dashboard with the Overall Posture ring, category scorecard and trend](img/dashboard.png)

The widget catalog, filters and date windows. If the question is what "7 of 12" means, read
[`posture.md`](posture.md) first.

Every widget reads live state from the findings table plus, for trend lines, the recorded trend
history; the daily posture snapshots only bridge the days before that history began. No widget reads the last scan's result blob, so a narrow scheduled run cannot make a
dashboard swing. Suppressed findings are excluded everywhere on a dashboard; the Scans page is where
you see them.

## The widget catalog

<!-- count:widget-types -->Thirteen widget types, added from the Add Widget panel:

| Widget | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Stat Card** | One number from a metric you pick: posture, open findings, critical, high, rules scanned, categories healthy, new or fixed. Carries the window's delta and any unknown count. |
| **Posture Ring** | The "X of Y passing" gauge for one category or overall, with "N not yet proven" underneath. |
| **Trend Chart** | Posture % over time, one series per category. |
| **Top Violating Rules** | The rules producing the most open findings. |
| **Category Scorecard** | One row per category: passing, open findings, delta. |
| **Recent Findings** | The newest findings, with category, severity and first-seen date. |
| **Severity Breakdown** | A donut of open findings by severity. |
| **Subscription Scorecard** | One row per subscription, graded against the rules that apply to it. |
| **Top Offending Resources** | The resources with the most open findings. |
| **Scan Coverage** | Last scan time per category, badged fresh, recent, stale or never against your threshold. |
| **New vs. Fixed** | Findings first seen against findings fixed, per day. |
| **Activity Occurrences** | Daily findings from activity rules. Empty until the Log Analytics backend lands. |
| **Advisories** | Open Advisories with rule, resource, severity and when each was last seen, most severe first and then most recently seen. Advisories are never counted as problems, so this is the one widget that lists them. A row opens the Advisories tab on Scans. |

Widgets showing findings or rules click through to the Scans page with the same filters applied, so
the list you land on is the list the number counted.

## Filters and scope

A dashboard has one filter bar applied to every widget: categories, subscriptions, resource groups,
tags, severities, rules, and a date window. A funnel indicator appears on the bar and on each widget
title while a filter is active, so a scoped number never looks global. Tags here are **rule** tags
(labels like `framework:iso27001`), not Azure resource tags.

Each widget also has a **Scope** panel with the same dimensions. A value set there **replaces** the
dashboard's value for that dimension on that widget; anything left on inherit takes the dashboard's.
Values never intersect, so if the dashboard is filtered to production and a widget's Scope names the
sandbox subscription, that widget shows the sandbox.

The date window is a rolling preset (24 hours, 7 or 30 days) or a custom range. A preset is stored as
"7 days" rather than two dates, so it keeps rolling. It drives anything that says new, fixed or
delta, the Trend and New vs. Fixed charts, and "vs baseline". It does not change what counts as open.

The trend serves every filter above, including a resource group, a tag, a severity, a rule and two or
more subscriptions, and it shows only what your Access lets you see
([`posture.md`](posture.md#trend)). A few things a widget will tell you about:

- **Gaps and no-scan days.** A day RuleBeat was not recording is a gap, and nothing is drawn across
  it. A recorded day on which no scan overlapped what the widget looks at is marked as a no-scan day.
- **"History at this level starts on `<date>`".** The days before recording began are bridged only for
  Everything with a category filter and for one whole subscription. At any other level the trend
  starts on its first recorded day and says so.
- **No baseline.** When there is no recorded day on or before the start of the window, the posture
  ring and the stat card say there is no baseline to compare with instead of showing a delta.

A failed data request shows "Couldn't load this widget" with a Retry, while genuinely absent data
shows an empty state, so a broken dashboard cannot pass for a clean tenant. And no enabled rules in
scope shows an empty posture rather than 0% or 100%.

## Managing dashboards

Create a blank dashboard, duplicate one for a per-team variant, rename, delete, set the default, or
Restore starter to recreate the seeded Overview layout. Every dashboard is deletable including the
default; deleting it promotes the oldest remaining one. Layouts save per dashboard. Creating,
renaming and deleting is audited; dragging and resizing is not, since every drag would be an entry
and would bury real changes. Viewers see every dashboard, editing needs the editor role
([`rbac.md`](rbac.md)).
